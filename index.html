  <h2>Rani Lakshmibai: Personal Life</h2>
  <p>
    In May 1852, Manikarnika was married to Gangadhar Rao Newalkar (Maharaja of Jhansi) and was later names as Lakshmibai as per the traditions. In 1851, Lakshmibai gave birth to her son Damodar Rao who died after 4 months. The couple later adopted Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed, Damodar Rao. The procedure of adaption was carried out in the presence of a British officer. A letter was handed to the officer from the Maharaja with the instructions that the adopted child should be given due respect and Jhansi should be given to Lakshmibai for her entire lifetime. 

    However, in November 1853, after the death of Maharaja, British East India Company, applied Doctrine of Lapse, under the Governor-General Lord Dalhousie. Under this policy, Damodar Rao's claim to the throne was rejected as he was adopted son of Maharaja and Rani. In March 1854, Lakshmibai was given Rs. 60,000 as annual pension and was asked to leave the palace.

<h2>
    Rani Lakshmibai: The 1857 Rebellion
</h2>
<p>
    On May 10, 1857, the Indian Rebellion started in Meerut. When this news reached Jhansi, Lakshmibai increased her protection and conducted a Haldi Kumkum ceremony to convince her people that the British were cowards and there's no need to fear them. 

    In June 1857, the 12th Bengal Native Infantry seized the Star Fort of Jhansi, persuaded British to lay their arms and promised no harm to them, but the Infantry broke their word and massacred the British officers. However, Lakshmibai's involvement in this incident is still a matter of debate. 
    
    Sepoys threatened Lakshmibai to blow up the palace, obtained huge money from Jhansi and left the place after 4 days of this incident. On March 24, 1858, the British forces bombarded the Jhansi. The defenders of Jhansi sent an appeal to Lakshmibai's childhood friend Tatya Tope. Tatya Tope responded to this request and sent more than 20,000 soldiers to fight against the British Army. However, the soldiers failed to relieve Jhansi. As the destruction continued, Rani Lakshmibai with her son escaped from the fort on her horse Badal. Badal died but the two of them survived.
